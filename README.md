In this project, I have created a COBOL program with the purpose of displaying a list of athletes for the Boca Juniors team. The program is divided into four sections: Identification, Environment, Data, and Procedure.

In the Identification section, I have declared the program name as "JEREMIAHSILVALOOP". In the Data section, I have defined the variables that will be used throughout the program.

The Procedure section is where the main logic of the program is located. The program starts at P1-BEGINNING and initializes the variables. Then, it goes to P2-PROCESSING-2 and adds 1 to the count variable, displays the Boca Juniors list, and performs a loop to display the athletes' numbers until it reaches 22. After the loop is completed, the program goes to P2-END and moves zeroes to the athletes variable. Finally, it goes to P3-FINALIZE and stops the program.

Overall, this COBOL program demonstrates how to use variables, loops, and conditional statements to achieve a specific task. It showcases the power and versatility of COBOL as a programming language.
